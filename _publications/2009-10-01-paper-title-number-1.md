Applied Support Vector Regression (SVR) and LSTM algorithms to predict commodity prices of import-export transactions. The dataset was from the United Nations Statistics Division website. The proposed model, incorporating a modified Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel with Fine-Tuning, demonstrates high accuracy and minimal overall error, enabling informed decision-making for economic growth. The accuracy (R2 Score) was greater than 85% in 90% cases.
