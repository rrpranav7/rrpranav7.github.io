Implemented and Presented a Fine-tuned Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, using Tensorflow library, on a real-time WHO dataset to forecast COVID-19 cases in twelve countries. The models achieved high accuracy (R2 score ≥ 0.7) and correlation coefficients (≥ 0.7), providing valuable insights for proactive strategies to reduce infections and developing country-specific models to predict and combat the global pandemic.
